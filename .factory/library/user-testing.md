# User Testing

Testing surface, required tools, resource cost classification per surface.

**What belongs here:** How to validate the game through its user surface, testing tools, resource constraints.

---

## Validation Surface

- **Primary surface**: Command-only validation (tests + typecheck + build)
- **User explicitly opted out of agent-browser validation** due to excessive CPU/memory usage from browser instances
- **Validation approach**: `npx vitest run` (all tests pass) + `npx tsc --noEmit` (zero errors) + `npm run build` (succeeds)
- **DO NOT use agent-browser** — no browser sessions, no screenshots, no interactive testing
- **DO NOT start browser instances** — validate through tests and type checking only

## Validation Concurrency

- **Max concurrent validators**: 5
- **Rationale**: Command-only validation (no browser). Each vitest run uses ~200MB. 16GB RAM with 8 cores. No browser overhead.

## Testing Infrastructure

- **Unit tests**: Vitest for pure logic modules (CombatSystem, PathfindingSystem, LootSystem, etc.)
- **Build verification**: `npm run build` (tsc + vite build) as quality gate
- **No e2e framework**: Visual validation via agent-browser screenshots only
- **Phaser mocking**: Tests must mock Phaser dependencies to run in Node environment

## Dev Server Management

- Start: `npx vite --port 5173`
- Healthcheck: `curl -sf http://localhost:5173`
- The dev server may already be running from user's terminal

## Flow Validator Guidance: Browser

**Surface**: Browser at http://localhost:5173

**Testing tool**: agent-browser skill (Chrome DevTools MCP)

**Isolation rules**:
- Each validator gets its own browser session via `--session` flag
- Session naming: `<workerSessionPrefix>__<group>` (e.g., `86077514a2eb__visual`)
- All validators share the single Vite dev server on port 5173
- Game state is per-browser-tab (IndexedDB is per-origin, so validators using same origin share storage)
- To avoid storage conflicts: each validator should start a new game rather than relying on saves
- Close browser sessions after testing

**Interaction approach**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Wait for game load (look for menu/title screen)
3. Start new game by clicking appropriate menu buttons (coordinate-based clicks on canvas)
4. Use keyboard shortcuts for interaction: WASD (move), 1-6 (skills), I/K/M/H/C/J/O (panels), TAB (auto-combat)
5. Take screenshots for visual evidence
6. Use `evaluate_script` to query internal game state when possible

**Key constraints**:
- Canvas is opaque to accessibility tree — you must use screenshots + coordinate clicks
- Phaser game runs at 1280×720 resolution
- Class selection is on the menu screen before gameplay starts
- Game auto-generates procedural sprites so all visuals will be present without external assets

**Common patterns**:
- To verify map rendering: start a game, move around with WASD, take screenshots at different positions
- To verify combat: engage monsters (walk near them), observe auto-combat or use skill keys
- To verify UI panels: press keyboard shortcut (I, K, M, etc.), screenshot the panel
- To check positions/coordinates: use evaluate_script to read player position from game state
- To access game internals via evaluate_script: `document.querySelector('canvas').__PHASER_GAME__` may not be exposed; instead use `Phaser.GAMES[0]` to get the game instance, then `game.scene.getScene('ZoneScene')` or `game.scene.getScene('UIScene')` to access scene data
- To read player stats: `(() => { const z = Phaser.GAMES[0].scene.getScene('ZoneScene'); return z?.playerStats; })()` — this object has skills, level, class, etc.
- To verify skill data: `(() => { const z = Phaser.GAMES[0].scene.getScene('ZoneScene'); return z?.playerStats?.skills; })()`
- To read combat system: `(() => { const z = Phaser.GAMES[0].scene.getScene('ZoneScene'); return z?.combatSystem; })()`

## Skills-Combat Milestone Testing Tips

- **Class selection**: On menu screen, 3 class buttons are displayed. Click the appropriate one to start with that class.
- **Skill tree (K key)**: Shows all skills for the class. Each skill card shows name, damage, mana cost, cooldown, etc.
- **Skill bar (1-6 keys)**: Bottom of screen HUD. Skills need to be assigned before they can be used.
- **Elite monsters**: Spawn randomly in zones. They have colored name labels with Chinese affix names.
- **Passive skills**: Warrior passives (Dual Wield Mastery, Unyielding, Life Regen) are always-on effects, not activated via skill bar.
- **New character for testing**: Always start a new game. Use keyboard shortcuts to cheat/modify state if needed via evaluate_script.
- **To give player skill points**: `(() => { const z = Phaser.GAMES[0].scene.getScene('ZoneScene'); if(z?.playerStats) { z.playerStats.skillPoints = 50; z.playerStats.level = 30; } return 'done'; })()`
- **To give player gold**: `(() => { const z = Phaser.GAMES[0].scene.getScene('ZoneScene'); if(z?.playerStats) z.playerStats.gold = 99999; return 'done'; })()`

## Lessons Learned (skills-combat round 1)

- **Phaser canvas interaction is extremely fragile**: Subagents spent most of their session budget wrestling with coordinate-based clicking and Phaser pointer event dispatch. For future milestones, prefer code-level verification + unit tests as primary validation, with browser screenshots as supplementary visual evidence.
- **Exposing `window.__PHASER_GAME__`** by modifying `main.ts` can help with eval-based game state access, but `Phaser.GAMES[0]` works without code changes.
- **Scene transitions break eval context**: Executing eval commands that trigger scene transitions (e.g., starting a game from menu) can cause the current game reference to become stale. Always re-query the scene after transitions.
- **Flaky test detected**: `skill-combat-integration.test.ts > Synergy Bonuses > Synergy bonus is applied in damage calculation` — fails intermittently due to random crit in `calculateDamage()`. The synergy logic is correct; the test needs to either seed randomness or run multiple iterations.
- **Recommended validation approach for Phaser games**: (1) Run comprehensive unit tests, (2) TypeScript type-check, (3) Code-level source review for wiring/integration, (4) Browser screenshots for visual layout confirmation. Interactive combat testing in-browser is low-value relative to time cost.
